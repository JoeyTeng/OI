<h2>Problem Description</h2>
<p>Rar the Cat has obtained a LED strip filled with <i>N</i> individual LED lights and wants to code them to light up in a certain manner. He at first labels the lights from 1 to <i>N</i>, and then lights the LEDs based on the rules below.</p>
<p>Initially, all the LED lights are turned off. Then for each positive integer not greater than <i>N</i>, (1..N), Rar the Cat toggles all the LED lights which labels are multiples of that number. Toggling a LED light means that if the light was originally on, it will now be turned off. If it was originally off, it would be turned on, akin to flipping a light switch.</p>
<p>As an example: When <i>N</i> is 10, Rar the Cat does the following steps in order:
<ol>
	<li>Initially, all the LED lights are turned off. (Off: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)</li>
	<li>Firstly, Rar the Cat toggles all the lights that are multiples of 1. (On: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)</li>
	<li>Secondly, Rar the Cat toggles all the lights that are multiples of 2. (On: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 | Off: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10)</li>
	<li>Thirdly, Rar the Cat toggles all the lights that are multiples of 3, thereby turning LED 3 and 9 off while turning LED 6 on. (On: 1, 5, 6, 7 | Off: 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10)</li>
	<li>Fourthly, Rar the Cat toggles all the lights that are multiples of 4, thereby turning LED 4 and 8 on. (On: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 | Off: 2, 3, 9, 10)</li>
	<li>Then, Rar the Cat toggles all the lights that are multiples of 5, thereby turning LED 5 off while turning LED 10 on. (On: 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10 | Off: 2, 3, 5, 9)</li>
	<li>Next, Rar the Cat toggles all the lights that are multiples of 6, thereby turning LED 6 off. (On: 1, 4, 7, 8, 10 | Off: 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10)</li>
	<li>Subsequently, Rar the Cat toggles all the lights that are multiples of 7, thereby turning LED 7 off. (On: 1, 4, 8, 10 | Off: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9)</li>
	<li>After that, Rar the Cat toggles all the lights that are multiples of 8, thereby turning LED 8 off. (On: 1, 4, 10 | Off: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)</li>
	<li>Finally, Rar the Cat toggles all the lights that are multiples of 9, thereby turning LED 9 on. (On: 1, 4, 9, 10 | Off: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8)</li>
	<li>Lastly, Rar the Cat toggles all the lights that are multiples of 10, thereby turning LED 10 off. (On: 1, 4, 9 | Off: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10)</li>
</ol>
