Case #1: AB BA
Case #2: AA BC C BA
Case #3: C C AB
Case #4: BA BB CA

The sample output displays one set of answers to the sample cases. Other answers may be possible.

In Case #1, there are two senators from each of the parties A and B. If we remove one from each party every time, the perfect balance is maintained until evacuation is complete.

Case #2 proceeds as follows:

Initially in the room: 3 A, 2 B, 2 C.
Evacuate AA. Still in the room: 1 A, 2 B, 2 C.
Evacuate BC. Still in the room: 1 A, 1 B, 1 C.
Evacuate C. Still in the room: 1 A, 1 B.
Evacuate AB. Evacuation complete!

Note that it would not be valid to begin the evacuation with BC, which would leave 3 A, 1 B, and 1 C in the room; party A would have an absolute majority (3 out of 5 = 60%).

For Case #3, note that CC AB would also be a valid answer, and C C AB is also valid even though it requires three evacuation steps instead of two.
